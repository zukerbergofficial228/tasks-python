Task: Friends of the Second Level

You are given a list of pairs of friends. Friendship is symmetric.

For each person, find their "second-level friends" â€” the friends of their friends,
excluding the person themselves and their direct friends.

Input format:
- Each line contains two names.
- Input ends with an empty line.

Output format:
- For each person, print the line:
  Person: Friend1, Friend2, ...
- Both people and friends must be printed in alphabetical order.
- No duplicates are allowed.
